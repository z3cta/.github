## 🧠 Why "z3cta"?

## Handle  
**z3cta**  
Pronounced: `ZAY-tuh`
The name “z3cta” is a stylized take on the Greek letter **Zeta (Ζ)**—a symbol often used in advanced mathematics, neural dynamics, and signal theory. It reflects our focus on the **underlying mechanics of intelligent systems**, and our mission to break them wide open.

## Doctrine  
**Curiosity. Code. Consequence.**

> You probe what others ignore.  
> You write the logic that reshapes the system.  
> You don’t react to consequences — you architect them.

## Meaning Behind "3C"
- **Curiosity**: The relentless need to explore what’s hidden or forbidden  
- **Code**: Your instrument of precision, subversion, and creation  
- **Consequence**: Not an afterthought — the output of intentional action
